Since its beginning, AFEI General Secretary has been involved in this project as one of the representatives of business sector.\r\nActivities started with distributing a questionnaire to various institutions concerned with setting and implementing the national policy for science, technology and innovation with the objective to assess the development sectors according to specific criteria (economic, scientific, social, and strategic significance) and the impact of research topics on each sector in order to define priority topics for research and development. Then, on2\/3\/2010, a workshop was organized with participation of a large number of researchers and business sector representatives where priorities of scientific research were discussed. Based on the results of the questionnaire, the priority sectors were defined (energy, agriculture, industry, water, health, communication, and capacity building); HCSR board of directors then added the \"environment\" to priority sectors.\r\nSectoral committees were established with a resolution of the prime minister and assigned the task of analyzing the status-quo of each sector, examining the future trends in it, and offering proposals for developing the sector through scientific research and technological development in harmony with priorities adopted for the sector and the 11th Five Year Plan. AFEI General Secretary participated in meetings and activities of the \"Industry sector committee\" as a representative of the business sector, and contributed with a paper on the AFEI vision for science, technology, and innovation policy in the engineering sector. The committee presented its proposal which was discussed in a workshop on 23\/12\/2010 with participation of the AFEI General Secretary and consultant from AFEI Damascus Office.\r\nRelated

the national policy for science, technology, and innovation in Syria\". Since its beginning, AFEI General Secretary has been involved in this project as one of the representatives of business sector.\r\nActivities started with distributing a questionnaire to various institutions concerned with setting and implementing the national policy for science, technology and innovation with the objective to assess the development sectors according to specific criteria (economic, scientific, social, and strategic significance) and the impact of research topics on each sector in order to define priority topics for research and development. Then, on2\/3\/2010, a workshop was organized with participation of a large number of researchers and business sector representatives where priorities of scientific research were discussed. Based on the results of the questionnaire, the priority sectors were defined (energy, agriculture, industry, water, health, communication, and capacity building); HCSR board of directors then added the \"environment\" to priority sectors.\r\nSectoral committees were established with a resolution of the prime minister and assigned the task of analyzing the status-quo of each sector, examining the future trends in it, and offering proposals for developing the sector through scientific research and technological development in harmony with priorities adopted for the sector and the 11th Five Year Plan. AFEI General Secretary participated in meetings and activities of the \"Industry sector committee\" as a representative of the business sector, and contributed with a paper on the AFEI vision for science, technology, and innovation policy in the engineering sector.

He confirmed that the cooperation of the group of employers with legislative and development institution nationally, regionally, and internationally created a brand name for the federation, and the federation is a counterpart in policy making and planning measures related to the sector. This would not have been possible without the faith each member has. Although the Federation umbrella brings the members closer, nevertheless, the priorities of each one in supporting the society and government are varied. Therefore, each country will focus on its own issues, i.e., the AFEI goals will be reached partially, and in different ways within the countries to fit their phase of development and priorities.\nDownloadable files:\nAgenda of the meetingsSpeech of AFEI Chairman of the BoardSpeech of AFEI General SecretryPresentation of the new strategic vision"},

He also stressed the need to continue the quest towards making AFEI a corner stone in the process of developing the economic regulations which would guarantee harmonization with the global developments and provide guidance to the economic development initiatives.\nMembers discussed the negative impact of current challenges in their countries manifesting primarily in the issue of getting visas to enter the country where the meeting is conducted. They also praised the efforts of the AFEI members of each country in contacting their national institutions to resolve issues in this regard.\nOn the discussion table also was the fact that AFEI includes a variety of different industries. Attendees agreed to consider this feature as an opportunity and proceed to establish homogeneous associations under the AFEI umbrella that would tackle specialized common issues. A good example of such endeavor is the Arab Cable Manufacturers Association which was launched in 2005.\nSome fundamental barriers to inter-Arab trade and investments were acknowledged. These are: the additional fees (beside tariff) on the products, prices of energy in some Arab countries, and dumping. As an association of employers, AFEI is requested to lobby for overcoming some obstacles. For that, the young industrialists' representative proposed to hire bright youth and offer mentorship and framework for them to come up with studies on how to tackle such common barriers as well as to change the mentality of \"what AFEI offers to members\" into \"what members can offer to AFEI\".\nAlongside the meetings, AFEI organized a seminar with two experts. Mr. Patrick Daru, ILO delivered a presentation titled \"Employers participation in skills development\", and Mr. Philip Chite, ESCWA delivered a presentation titled \"Current and prospected trade opportunities for the engineering industries in the Arab world\"."}
